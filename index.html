<h2>On thursday we did this:</h2>

<p> We are going to add images and a hyper link into this page. for now you can use the link of your username.github.io as the link as a redirect back to 
your main page. This<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp"> link</a> here shows how to add a hyperlink to your text. the tag itself can be inside a paragraph. 
  Use the f12 key to inspect this webpage and look through how i've embedded this link into this paragraph. </p>



 <p> We are also going to add images to our html file. it is very similiar to how we add images in the markdown language on our homepage.
 We use the tag img src="url" alt="alternativetext" you can think of the alt text like an alternative name we can reference if we need to do things with the
   image like hide it or change it. 
 </p>   
    


    <h2> Today we are going to create a css stylesheet
    </h2>

    <p> A css stylesheet is a file that takes all the style elements that we would want to apply to a webpage and allows us to make broad implementations just one. we can even
    use this as its own location in a repository so we can use it again and again with minimal effort.</p>
