      Nice weather we are having today..
      we are going to edit the text within our index.html file today. there are a few things we can do including changing font, font size, 
      color of text, background color of text , and its placement. These are part of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) a format that changes the visual
      elements of a html document. we can do quite a lot with these.

<h2>Today we are doing this:</h2>

<p> We are going to add images and a hyper link into this page. for now you can use the link of your username.github.io as the link as a redirect back to 
your main page. This<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp"> link</a> here shows how to add a hyperlink to your text. the tag itself can be inside a paragraph. 
  Use the f12 key to inspect this webpage and look through how i've embedded this link into this paragraph. </p>



 <h2> We are also going to add images to our html file. it is very similiar to how we add images in the markdown language on our homepage.
 We use the tag img src="url" alt="alternativetext" you can think of the alt text like an alternative name we can reference if we need to do things with the
   image like hide it or change it.
