      Nice weather we are having today..
      we are going to edit the text within our index.html file today. there are a few things we can do including changing font, font size, 
      color of text, background color of text , and its placement. These are part of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) a format that changes the visual
      elements of a html document. we can do quite a lot with these.
